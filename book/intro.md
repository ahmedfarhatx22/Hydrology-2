***Book version: v{{ "1.0.0" }}***

Welcome to the hydrology textbook! We are thrilled to guide you through the essential principles, concepts, and applications of hydrology within the pages of this textbook. Whether you're an experienced researcher, an inquisitive learner, or new to the field, this textbook is designed to be your trusted companion in unraveling the intricate dynamics of water on our planet.

***How to find what you are looking for in the book*** <br>

There is a more advanced way to search for a word in the book than pressing __Ctrl + F__. This advanced method can be accessed in two ways:

Method 1: using the __keyboard shortcut__:

1. Press __Ctrl + K__ and type the word or sentence you are looking for.
2. This will search the entire book and display all results, specifying the chapters where the term is found.
3. Click on the desired chapter, and it will open with your search term highlighted throughout the chapter.

Method 2: Using the __search tool__:

1. Click the search tool located at the top left of the book, just below the TU Delft logo.
2. Follow the same procedure as with the keyboard shortcut to search for and highlight your term in the relevant chapters.  

**Using Interactive Plots in JupyterBook**

Interactive plots let you explore data dynamically with sliders, zoom, and reset options:

1. Sliders: Adjust parameters, and the plot updates automatically.
2. Zoom: Click and drag to zoom in on a specific area.
3. Reset View: Double-click anywhere to reset the plot.
4. Hover: Move your mouse over points to see details.
5. Legend: Click items to show/hide data; double-click to isolate a series.

**Using Hypothesis for Private Highlights**

How to highlight in Jupyter Book:

1. click the Hypothesis icon (or select text), choose Highlight, and ensure it’s set to *Only Me* for privacy. Make an account on **hypothes.is** if needed. 

View Your Highlights Later:
