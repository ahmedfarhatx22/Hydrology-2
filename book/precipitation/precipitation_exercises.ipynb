    "a) The so-called Marshall-Palmer relation ($Z=200R^{1.6}$) is often used to relate radar reflectivity $Z$ [$\\frac{\\text{mm}^6}{\\text{m}^{3}}$] and rainfall intensity $R$ [$\\frac{\\text{mm}}{\\text{h}}$]. Suppose a weather radar measures a reflectivity of 1000 $\\frac{\\text{mm}^6}{\\text{m}^{3}}$. What is the corresponding rainfall rate? And what is the rainfall rate for $Z$=100,000 $\\frac{\\text{mm}^6}{\\text{m}^{3}}$?\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Since $Z$ can vary strongly over orders of magnitude while this is not the case for $R$, it is common to express $Z$ in decibels (dBZ). This is a logarithmic scale defined as $10 \\times \\log(Z)$, with $\\log$ the logarithm with base 10. Suppose it rains with an intensity of 10 $\\frac{\\text{mm}}{\\text{h}}$, what reflectivity (in dBZ) will be measured by the weather radar?\n",
