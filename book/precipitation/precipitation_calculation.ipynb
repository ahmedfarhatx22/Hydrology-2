    "## Spatial variation of rainfall\n",
    "\n",
    "Spatial variation of rainfall can be extremely important in hydrology because of spatially varying soil properties and land use types. The interplay between rainfall spatial variability and the stream channel network topology of a catchment can also have a large impact on its hydrologic behaviour. It is therefore important to characterize this spatial variability of rainfall to be able to draw conclusions on the behaviour of a catchment, in particular during extreme events. The variogram can be used to describe this spatial variability in a statistical manner. A variogram (which is short for *semivariogram*) is a geostatistical tool to describe the spatial variation of a field (rainfall in this case). It is often assumed that the spatial rainfall field is statistically stationary (the mean, variance, and spatial correlation of the field are independent of the location in space) and isotropic (the spatial correlation does not depend on direction). The correlation of the field at two points in space can then be expressed as a function of only the distance between these two points (i.e., independent of the position and direction).\n",
