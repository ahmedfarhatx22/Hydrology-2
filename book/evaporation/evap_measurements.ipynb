    "# Measuring evaporation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various methods to measure evaporation. They can be classified into two categories: methods that are based on the water balance or those that make use of micro-meteorological techniques. Depending on the spatial and temporal scale a method can be more or less suitable. In {numref}`fig:space_time` an overview is given. In general, you can say that the water balance methods work well at either the larger catchment scale or at the smaller spatial scales (m$^2$ to hectares). While the micro-meteorological methods nicely fill the gap between the hectare to km$^2$ scale. In the temporal domain, the micro-meteorological methods perform better at time scales less than a day, while the water balance methods can expand to the yearly scale. \n",

    "### Catchment water balance\n",
    "Via the water balance we can estimate the total evaporation of a catchment:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "E_a=P-Q-\\frac{\\textrm{d}S}{\\textrm{d}t}\n",
    "$$ (evap_catchment)\n",
    "\n",
    "Precipitation ($P$) and river discharge ($Q$) measurements are frequently available, especially at large time scales (monthly, yearly). On the other hand, data on storage changes is more difficult to obtain. These storage changes can include:\n",
    "- Surface water: changed water levels, readable on level gauge;\n",
    "- Groundwater: changed groundwater levels, readable in monitoring wells. The increase in groundwater storage is equal to the increase in the groundwater level multiplied by the storage coefficient;\n",
    "- Soil moisture: increase in soil moisture content, determined by sampling or with a neutron probe.\n",
    "Hence information on all these components is required, which is often not the case. Therefore the catchment water balance approach is often only used at the yearly time scale because then the storage change can be neglected ($\\textrm{d}S/(\\textrm{1 year}) \\approx 0$). The water balance then simplifies into $E=P-Q$. It is important to realize that the error that arises with this calculation method is a summation of errors in the measured variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lake water balance\n",
    "Also for lakes the water balance method can be applied if the inflow ($Q_{in}$), outflow ($Q_{out}$), and water level ($h$) are measured:\n",

    "### Pan evaporation\n",
    "\n",
    "The most straightforward method to measure open water evaporation directly is with a pan ({numref}`fig:classaevaporation`). The pan is filled with water and every time interval (e.g., daily) the water level is measured. The drop in the water level divided by the time interval gives the rate of open water evaporation. Of course, the water level difference should be compensated for rainfall. Therefore, next to the pan, a rain gauge should be installed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Various types of pans are in use, such as the sunken pan, floating pan and surface pan. The use of the surface pan is most widely spread, despite its shortcomings. The most common is the U.S. Weather Bureau Class A-Pan, with a diameter of 4ft and depth of 10 inches. The water level is maintained 2-3 inches below the rim ({numref}`fig:classaevaporation`). \n",

    "Class A-pans are also used to estimate the potential evaporation over land mainly for irrigation purposes. Then the pan is installed in the field and it is assumed that $E_o \\approx E_p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the Class A-pan is a direct method, one should be careful with assuming that the pan evaporation is an estimate for the open water evaporation. Often the pan evaporation is higher than the open water evaporation due to the warming of the sides by the sun. The shallow pan reacts much faster to temperature changes than deep water. To reduce this effect the pan can be installed on floats in a lake or one can make use of correction factors (see e.g., {cite:t}`grismer-2002` for an overview). \n",
    "\n",
    "To correct this, empirical *pan coefficients* have been entered:\n",

    "\\quad \\text{[L/T]}\n",
    "$$ (pancoefficient)\n",

    "Coefficients are mainly derived for the American class-A pan. The values of the pan coefficients can vary widely for different circumstances. However, the average monthly evaporation values determined with the evaporation pan, give a maximum error of about 10. Data about evaporation in pans are always valuable for comparing the evaporation at different places and times. "

    "### Lysimeters\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the oldest and most straightforward ways to measure evaporation is with lysimeters. Lysimeters make use of the mass balance, whereby the known in- and outgoing fluxes and the storage are measured. Rainfall, percolation and soil moisture should often be measured to determine the evaporation (mass balance). The soil moisture can be measured with soil moisture probes but in the case of so-called weighing lysimeters ({numref}`fig:lysimeter`) the water storage can be determined by the weight changes of the lysimeter. Often load cells are used to weigh the lysimeter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lysimeters can measure different types of evaporation, depending on the material inside the lysimeter. Forest floor interception can be measured with a lysimeter by filling it with forest floor material {cite:p}`Gerrits2007`. And total evaporation can be determined by filling the lysimeter with vegetation and a soil layer. Open water evaporation can be estimated by filling the lysimeter with water (the lysimeter is hydrologically isolated so the leakage loss $ε$ = 0). So a pan is also a lysimeter. \n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of lysimeters is that they are conceptually simple, accurate, and have a fast time response {cite:p}`Gash2007`. Disadvantages are that the edges of the lysimeter can disturb the measurements (altering the wind flow paths, roots, heat source, etc.) and that the soil and vegetation sample will be disturbed {cite:p}`Pruitt1960`. One should also take care that the soil moisture inside the lysimeter is similar to the surroundings. With pumps, this can be accomplished. Furthermore, lysimeters often have a small spatial sample and especially large lysimeters are expensive to construct. Due to these high costs large lysimeters are currently not often used anymore, although they provide accurate (actual) evaporation results. \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Lysimeters are applied:\n",
    "- To determine the evaporation term $E$ in the water balance for a specific area;\n",
    "- To determine the influence of evaporation on the depth of the groundwater level, the soil condition, or the crop;\n",
    "- To determine the drainage, the replenishment of the groundwater or useful precipitation;\n",
    "- To determine condensation and dew (only possible due to weighing);\n",
    "- To study the chemical composition of the drained water in connection with the uptake and deposition of substances in the soil.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the largest lysimeters worldwide are the Davis lysimeters of the University of California {cite:p}`Pruitt1960` which are still operational, and the lysimeters in Castricum (The Netherlands). Although the lysimeters in Castricum are not operational anymore, in 2011 they digitalized all the data from the four 25x25x2.5 meter lysimeters filled with bare soil, dune scrubs, deciduous, and pine. This data is freely available and can be used for research. Currently, three new large lysimeters (30 x 12 m) are built by the University of Arizona to investigate the effect of climate change on vegetation. The lysimeters are constructed in a greenhouse facility where they can control the environment."

    "### Scintillometer\n",
    "A scintillometer makes use of the fact that when water evaporates from a surface, temperature and humidity fluctuations in the near-surface atmospheric boundary layer will occur. These fluctuations cause air density variations, which can be observed when a beam of electromagnetic radiation is emitted from a transmitter to a receiver. By analyzing the intensity variations (or scintillations) in the received signal either the sensible or the latent heat flux can be obtained depending on the used wavelength. When the visible and near-infrared waveband is used the air density differences are mainly caused by temperature fluctuations and hence the scintillometer gives the sensible heat flux. These scintillometers are called Large or Extra-Large Aperture Scintillometers (see {numref}`fig:scintillometer`) and have proven to give accurate line average sensible heat flux estimates up to 10 km and are most often used {cite:p}`mcaneney-1995`. Combined with net radiation measurements actual evaporation can be determined when the energy balance is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scintillometers can also directly give the latent heat flux. When the micro-to-millimeter waveband is used, the air density differences are most sensitive to moisture fluctuations. {cite:t}`meijninger-2006` showed that these scintillometers can give reasonable evaporation estimates. However, these Small Aperature Scintillometers (SAS) are more expensive compared to Large Aperature Scintillometers (LAS) and are (thus) less commonly used.\n",
