    "Humans affect the water cycle in many ways, sometimes intentionally and sometimes unintentionally, and with positive as well as negative effects. Changes in land use, for example, such as replacing natural forest by agricultural land or changing one crop for another, may change evaporation and infiltration. In addition, they may change the local and regional climate and thereby precipitation. These changes in evaporation, infiltration and precipitations may in turn significantly increase or decrease groundwater levels and river discharge."

Improved drainage, in the form of drainage ditches or underground drainage pipes, reduces waterlogging and increases runoff from the fields. It may also result in higher peak river discharges, more flooding downstream and more drought problems locally as less water is retained.\n",

    "When irrigation water is abstracted from a nearby river, the discharge of that river obviously decreases, which can create or worsen water scarcity problems downstream. If the discharge of that river is very variable, a reservoir can be constructed to store water in the wet season for use in the dry season. If there is no river nearby with sufficient discharge, groundwater may be used instead or water may be imported from other river basins.\n",
    "Reservoirs result in more open water evaporation, especially when they have a large surface area and are located in hot and dry regions, such as Lake Nasser in Sudan and Egypt ({numref}`Lake_Nasser_reservoir`). In addition, they can trap sediments, which decreases effective storage and may result in erosion of the river bed downstream. They may moreover reduce flooding downstream. This may be positive, but also negative if downstream wetlands disappear and floodplains become less fertile and dry out. And last but not least, reservoirs result in loss of land and require relocation of the people living on the land (see also {numref}`reservoirs`).\n",

If the decrease is large, surface water sources may run dry and groundwater abstraction may become too expensive.

This can raise peak water levels and increase flooding problems. In addition, sediments can no longer be deposited on the floodplains and part of these sediments will be deposited on the river bed. In combination with activities that cause land subsidence, such as groundwater abstraction and drainage of peat areas, this can result in rivers that run higher than the surrounding land (see {numref}`Polder`; {cite:p}`van_de_ven_man-made_2004`)."
