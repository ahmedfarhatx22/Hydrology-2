This method, which relies on the principle of mass conservation (often assuming constant water density and therefore translating to volume conservation), is expressed through a single equation:\n",

    "\n",
    "The equation can be applied to all storages and fluxes shown in {numref}`UWB`. To create a hydrological model, the various mass balances are integrated into a single model, such that the outflow $Q_{out}$ of one storage is the inflow $Q_{in}$ of the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model can be applied either as a dynamic model, calculating the fluxes at every timestep $t$, or as a cumulative model, which estimates the fluxes over a longer period of time. The latter is more computationally efficient but may miss some of the faster dynamics that occur in the urban environment. With this in mind, we will mainly focus on the dynamic implementation of the mass-balance modeling approach while also providing some examples of the cumulative model implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The temporal and spatial scales should be considered before setting up the model. This decision depends on the objectives of the model and the properties of the system. These considerations will be examined per sub-section of the model. Below, we will analyze the mass balance for each section and highlight the spatio-temporal considerations. In this implementation, we will consider the atmosphere, the open water system, and the deep groundwater as boundary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key concept of urban hydrology (compared to \"natural hydrology\") is that all the storages have *storage capacities*, and all the fluxes have *maximum flux rates*. The fluxes out of the system are often dependent on whether the storage capacity or (one of) the maximum flux rates has been reached. The capacities and maximum flux rates, combined with the conditional statements, are highlighted per storage unit below.\n"

    "As you can see, this is a straightforward equation where the peak outflow can be calculated. Calculating the peak outflow, as opposed to total volumes, is particularly useful in urban hydrology, as it allows for the *design* of systems to accommodate a given flow rate. The Rational Method is therefore often used in the design of combined sewer overflow structures, stormwater settling tanks (*NL: bergbezinkbasins*), and other *stedelijke kunstwerken* (urban hydraulic structures).  \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key challenges in applying the Rational Method is determining the runoff coefficient $c_{r}$. The runoff coefficient is largely analogous to the *total imperviousness* of an area: for example, if an area is **80% impervious**, a $c_{r}$ value of **0.8** is used.  \n",

    "### Hydrograph Super-position\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, taking the weighted average of the runoff coefficients allows for the modeling of the entire catchment as one. But why is this possible? Thanks to a phenomenon known as *superposition*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Superposition is the process where we take individual contributions (*hydrographs*) from various sub-catchments and add them into a single hydrograph. Consider the following conceptualization of a catchment: a branched sewer network.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Time of Concentration  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we showed that the peak of the superposition-based hydrograph is equal to the outcome of the Rational Method. However, this is not always the case. To assess the applicability of the Rational Method in calculating peak runoff given a certain rainfall input, we need one more concept: *Time of Concentration*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By definition, the time of concentration ($ToC$, [$T$]) is the duration of the longest path to the outflow ($T_{longest}$, [$T$]) minus the shortest path ($T_{shortest}$, [$T$]):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "ToC = T_{longest} - T_{shortest}\n",
    "$$ (eq:time_of_concentration)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we consider the example from the previous section, the longest path (*A-outfall*) takes **7 minutes**, while the shortest path (*D-outfall*) takes only **1 minute**. This means that the ToC is **6 minutes**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We use the ToC to determine if the peak outflow can be calculated using the Rational Method. For this to be valid, the following condition must be met:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "ToC \\geq T_{rain}\n",
    "$$ (eq:toc_condition)  \n",
    "\n",
    "where $T_{rain}$ is the duration of the rainfall event used to determine the peak outflow.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This condition is derived from the key principle of hydrograph superposition: the hydrographs can only *all* be superimposed at the outflow if the respective peaks arrive at the same time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this, we will model three scenarios: rainfall intensities of **10 mm/hr**, lasting for **5, 6, and 7 minutes**, respectively.  \n",
    "\n",
    "From the results, you can see that the 5min rainfall event case <span style=\"color: red;\">we have to finalise this based on the code</span>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of time of concentration is not only useful to assess if the Rational Method can be applied, but it can also be used to determine the critical rainfall duration.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking back to the **IDF curves** <span style=\"color: red;\">ref back to these curves, I assume they were discussed in the rainfall section</span>, shorter rainfall events have a higher intensity. However, if the intensities are below the time of concentration, the resulting peak flow is not necessarily higher compared to a less intense but longer-duration rainfall event, where all the individual hydrographs in the system could be superimposed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Having an idea of the travel times of water through a catchment is therefore a key starting point when designing the relevant outflow points. The typical velocity in a sewer network is **1 m/s**.\n"
