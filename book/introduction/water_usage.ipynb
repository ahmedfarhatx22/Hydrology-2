    "The Netherlands always had to defend itself against water. Over time, its inhabitants have employed various methods for this defensive purpose. Typical Dutch examples are mounds (terpen), dikes, and windmills. The struggle against water and water-related issues is a common thread of our history. The current layout and organization of the Netherlands have also been strongly influenced by this historical battle. Additionally, the use of water for defense, as seen in the Dutch Water Lines, has also played a role. Less well-known but equally important is the historical situation regarding water quality in the Netherlands. Not too long ago, in the 19th century, thousands of people died from cholera epidemics caused by contaminated water used as drinking water. The quality of surface water in major cities was severely compromised due to household waste discharges and its use as a public sewer. This poor water quality was a key reason for establishing public drinking water supply systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "For drinking water and industrial water supply, about 1,100 million mÂ³/yr of groundwater is extracted {cite:p}`vewin-2022`. However, such extraction has consequences. Groundwater levels can drop, and the direction of groundwater flow can change. However, these effects are usually unwanted, since lowerings of groundwater level usually influence ecology, subsidence, and droughts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hydrological research, however, has shown that only about 25% of these desiccation issues can be attributed to withdrawals for drinking water supply . The majority of the problems is caused by drainage for agriculture, polder water management, and lowering due to urbanization. The decline in natural values is also due to acidification of rainwater and excessive use of fertilizers. The combination of drying out, acidification, and eutrophication has proven disastrous for sensitive areas' natural values. On the contrary, hydrological research has revealed that reducing groundwater extraction for drinking water supply does not automatically lead to the restoration of natural values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another crucial point of focus is the relationship between hydrology and ecology. The availability of sufficient water with the right quality is a critical prerequisite for developing and maintaining a desired ecosystem. All engineers involved in researching, designing, constructing, and managing water engineering systems must fully realize that this has effects on the environment. These effects could include changes in flow patterns, lowering of groundwater levels, reduction in groundwater seepage, and changes in water quality. Therefore, the work of hydrologists/civil engineers is increasingly more affiliated within ecological frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, water also plays a significant role in the abiotic environment. The formation of the Netherlands, from a morphological perspective, has been significantly influenced by water. The associated processes contribute to the abiotic nature. This is important to emphasize because nature development and conservation often refer only to green nature. However, the formation of dunes, the formation of the soil with layers of sand and clay through river and sea deposits, is a part of nature development as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past, attempts were often made to design the water management situation based on economic insights. Flood prevention was a priority, so drainage systems were improved, streams were straightened or deepened, and canals were dug. Rivers were normalized or channelized. By enhancing agricultural water management, often through land consolidations, substantial increases in crop productivity were achieved. The Delta Works ensured the safety of Southwest Netherlands, which up until this represents a great alteration to our original water management system.\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of that, water is assigned to various other functions as well. For instance, the transportation function via water, such as navigation on rivers and canals, and the use of surface water for cooling purposes at power plants. In the past, it was also common to use rivers for transporting waste materials to the sea, but nowadays, this is no longer deemed acceptable."
