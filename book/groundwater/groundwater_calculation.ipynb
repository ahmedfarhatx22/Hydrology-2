The relationship between head difference and the flow of groundwater was first proved by Henry Darcy in 1856 with an experiment. The used setup is shown in {numref}`fig:GW_modelling_darcyexperiment` {cite:p}`Darcy1856`. \n",

    "In this experiment, a cylinder is filled with aquifer material (such as sand) and the ends of the cylinder are connected to two reservoirs with different water levels. Water flows through the aquifer material from the reservoir with the highest water level to the reservoir with the lowest water level. With this setup, Darcy showed that the *discharge* (NL: *debiet*) through the soil column is proportional to the head difference $h_1-h_2$ and the cross-sectional area $A$ of the column, and inversely proportional to the length $L$ of the soil column (Equation {eq}`darcyslaw`).\n",

    "To describe flow in an aquifer, the term *specific discharge* (NL: *specifiek debiet*) is used. It is the discharge per unit area of aquifer normal to the direction of the flow. Since water can flow in three directions, the specific discharge is expressed as a vector:\n",

    "Darcy's formula describes flow in three dimensions. In practice, the flow through an aquifer in the horizontal direction is several orders of magnitude larger than the flow in the vertical direction. {cite:t}`Dupuit1863` recognized that in many cases the vertical variation of the horizontal components of flow may be neglected, in essence reducing the mathematical description to a two-dimensional problem in the horizontal (x and y) plane. This allows many problems to be solved in a simple form that otherwise could not be solved. \n",

Instead of the specific discharge, the discharge per aquifer width is used by multiplying the specific discharge by the height of the aquifer $H$ in case of confined flow, or the height of the phreatic surface in case of unconfined flow ({numref}`fig:confined_unconfined`). \n",

    "### Flow types\n",
    "\n",
    "Groundwater flow may be classified according to the spatial dimensions of the flow field, the dependence of the flow on time, and the aquifer setting in which the flow occurs. These different dimensions describe the flow field as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Spatial dimension: \n",
    "\n",
    "\tFlow in an aquifer can be one-, two- or three-dimensional. For relatively thin aquifers, the Dupuit approximation often produces accurate results, and one- and two-dimensional analyses are often adequate;\n",
    "- Time dependence:\n",
    "\n",
    "\tGroundwater flow is either steady or transient. Steady flow means there are no changes in flow or head over time $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} q =0$. Transient flow occurs when the boundary conditions change over time, leading to differences in flow and head over time;\n",
    "- Geologic setting:\n",
    "\n",
    "\tThe geologic setting may further be used to describe groundwater flow. Flow is confined when the head in the aquifer is above the impermeable top of the aquifer. The area of the flow is therefore constant. Flow is unconfined when the head is equal to the phreatic surface. This complicates calculations because the area of flow depends on the groundwater level, which in turn depends on recharge and depletion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus in this chapter is on 1D and 2D steady and transient flow. In confined flow, the area of flow in the aquifer is constant, which simplifies calculations. The area of flow depends on the hydraulic head for unconfined flow. To solve the equations for unconfined flow the same approach can be taken as shown in this chapter, with the difference being that the area of flow is variable."

    "In most cases, groundwater eventually discharges into rivers or oceans. In coastal aquifers, freshwater starts to float on top of salty seawater in the aquifer. The salty groundwater extends far inland, which is called saltwater intrusion. Intrusion does not necessarily mean the movement of water, it could also mean the presence of saltwater in equilibrium. Saltwater can be present far inland and could lead to problems for agriculture and drinking water production. Salt groundwater can be found almost everywhere in the Netherlands, although at a larger depth further away from the coast, while in the west of the Netherlands the shallow groundwater is already brackish. \n",
    "\n",
    "The density of salt water is higher than the density of freshwater because salt is dissolved in the groundwater. The density of freshwater is $\\rho \\approx 1000$ kg/m$^3$ while the density of salt seawater is around $\\rho \\approx 1025$ kg/m$^3$. The freshwater therefore floats atop the salt water under normal circumstances and forms a so-called *freshwater lens* (NL: *zoetwaterlens*) on top of the salt water. The fresh water originates from precipitation and flows through the aquifer, eventually discharging into the sea as shown in {numref}`fig:GW_processes_hydrocyclegroundwater`. The saltwater and freshwater are mixed in the transition zone between salt and freshwater. \n",

Having set those allows to predict the groundwater level using projected evaporation and precipitation data. Please note that when there are changes in the environment the model needs re-calibration.
